}
```

## Architecture

### Clean Code Structure
The project follows SOLID principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
SuiteView/
├── Models/                    # Data models
│   ├── AppSettings.cs         # Application settings with JSON serialization
│   └── ColorTheme.cs          # Color theme data structure
│
├── Managers/                  # Business logic (all implement best practices)
│   ├── ConfigManager.cs       # JSON persistence with IDisposable
│   ├── ThemeManager.cs        # Static theme registry
│   ├── DockingManager.cs      # Docking calculations (well-commented)
│   ├── SystemTrayManager.cs   # System tray with IDisposable
│   └── StartupManager.cs      # Registry integration (safe operations)
│
├── Forms/                     # UI layer
│   ├── MainForm.cs            # Main toolbar window (custom rendering)
│   └── SettingsForm.cs        # Settings dialog
│
├── Utils/                     # Reserved for future utilities
└── Program.cs                 # Application entry point
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Manager Pattern**: Separate managers for distinct responsibilities
- **Dependency Injection**: ConfigManager injected into forms
- **Repository Pattern**: ThemeManager as static repository
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven system tray interactions
- **Singleton Pattern**: Static managers for cross-cutting concerns

### Code Quality Features
- ✅ XML documentation comments on all public members
- ✅ Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ IDisposable implementation for resource cleanup
- ✅ Graceful degradation (missing JSON file handling)
- ✅ SOLID principles followed
- ✅ Clean, readable code structure

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Docking Logic ([DockingManager.cs](SuiteView/Managers/DockingManager.cs))
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Calculates the docked position based on current window position and size
/// Supports 8 dock positions with smart edge detection
/// Handles multi-monitor scenarios seamlessly
/// </summary>
public static (Point Location, DockPosition DockPosition, bool ShouldDock)
    CalculateDockPosition(Point windowLocation, Size windowSize, int monitorIndex)
```

**Features:**
- Smart edge detection within 50px threshold
- Automatic corner detection
- Multi-monitor aware positioning
- Screen bounds validation

### 2. Multi-Monitor Support
The application handles complex monitor scenarios:
- Validates monitor indices on startup
- Finds correct monitor for window center point
- Repositions to primary monitor if saved monitor unavailable
- Updates monitor index during drag operations

### 3. Configuration Persistence ([ConfigManager.cs](SuiteView/Managers/ConfigManager.cs))
- Auto-creates AppData directory if missing
- Graceful handling of corrupted/missing JSON
- Validates settings on load (e.g., opacity 70-100%)
- Thread-safe operations
- Implements IDisposable for cleanup

### 4. Theme System ([ThemeManager.cs](SuiteView/Managers/ThemeManager.cs))
- Static initialization of 5 carefully designed themes
- Coordinated 2-3 color palettes
- Separate text colors for accessibility
- Easy theme switching with live preview

### 5. Startup Integration ([StartupManager.cs](SuiteView/Managers/StartupManager.cs))
- Safe registry operations with error handling
- Validates existing registry entries
- Removes stale entries on disable
- Uses current executable path

## Extensibility

### Widget System Ready
The main form includes a content panel ready for widgets:

```csharp
// Location: MainForm.cs, line 84
_contentPanel = new Panel
{
    Location = new Point(0, TitleBarHeight),
    AutoScroll = true,
    BackColor = _currentTheme.Secondary
};

// Future widgets and tools will be added here
// Example: _contentPanel.Controls.Add(new CustomWidget());
```

### Adding Custom Widgets
1. Create a `UserControl` that inherits from `Control`
2. Implement themed UI using `_currentTheme` properties
3. Add to `_contentPanel.Controls` in `MainForm.InitializeComponent()`
4. Widget automatically inherits scrolling, theming, and docking behavior

### Example Widget Structure
```csharp
public class ClockWidget : UserControl
{
    public ClockWidget(ColorTheme theme)
    {
        this.BackColor = theme.Secondary;
        this.ForeColor = theme.Accent;
        // Add clock UI elements
    }
}
```
